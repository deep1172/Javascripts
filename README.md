# Javascript for web app Development 

## What is JavaScript?

✅ High-level programming language.

✅ Interpreted language – runs directly in browsers or via engines like Node.js.

✅ Dynamically typed – no need to declare variable types.

✅ Multi-paradigm – supports functional, object-oriented, and imperative styles.

✅ Primarily used for web development to make pages interactive.

✅ Runs on the client-side (browser), but also on the server-side using Node.js.

✅ Can manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to dynamically change HTML and CSS.

✅ Asynchronous capabilities using callbacks, promises, and async/await.

✅ Supported by all modern web browsers.

✅ Core technologies of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
